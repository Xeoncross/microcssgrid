As my work in the realm of front-end design has grown over the last several years, I found myself drawn to the world of CSS grids. These pre-built style sheets help to establish a common design standard that makes it easy to design themes. They also save the hassle of re-creating those familiar "float rules" with each new template.

However, like all my work, performance and simplicity nagged me. I was put off by the size of these files and finally took the best of my favorite grids (like http://960.gs and http://1kbgrid.com) and edited them into a 960 grid system that is only *960 bytes in size*.

Now I can use this CSS grid in any project I want without guilt about wasting bandwidth on extra rules that I never use. Further more, the syntax is almost the same as the 960.gs *we have all been is so drawn too*.
